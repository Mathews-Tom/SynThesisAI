# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SynThesisAI represents a transformational evolution from the existing synthetic math prompts agent repository into a comprehensive, self-optimizing, multi-domain AI platform. The system leverages DSPy's declarative programming paradigm and agentic reinforcement learning to generate high-quality educational content across Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STREAM) domains. This platform addresses critical limitations in current educational content generation while introducing advanced capabilities for automated prompt optimization, multi-agent coordination, curriculum-driven content generation, and comprehensive quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educational content creator, I want a unified platform that can generate high-quality educational content across all STREAM domains, so that I can efficiently create diverse learning materials without domain-specific expertise.

2. WHEN content is generated for any domain THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent quality metrics and validation standards across all domains
3. WHEN a user specifies learning objectives and difficulty levels THEN the system SHALL generate content that aligns with those specifications
4. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL achieve greater than 95% accuracy in content validation
5. WHEN generating content across domains THEN the system SHALL maintain less than 3% false positive rate in quality assessment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated prompt optimization and system self-improvement capabilities, so that I can reduce manual maintenance overhead and improve system performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates content THEN it SHALL use DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to automatically optimize prompts without manual intervention

4. WHEN optimization cycles complete THEN the system SHALL cache optimization results to avoid redundant computations
5. WHEN system performance is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate 200-400% throughput improvement through parallel processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want comprehensive multi-layered validation systems, so that I can ensure all generated content meets fidelity, utility, and pedagogical value standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL validate content through universal validation framework covering fidelity, utility, safety, and pedagogical value
2. WHEN domain-specific content is created THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate domain-specific validation rules and checks
3. WHEN content validation occurs THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reasoning traces that provide educational transparency
4. WHEN safety validation runs THEN the system SHALL ensure all content meets ethical guidelines and safety standards
5. WHEN pedagogical scoring is performed THEN the system SHALL assess educational effectiveness and learning objective alignment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want scalable distributed computing capabilities, so that I can deploy the system from individual development machines to enterprise-grade multi-GPU clusters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources using Kubernetes cluster management
2. WHEN processing workloads THEN the system SHALL optimize resource allocation based on workload predictions
3. WHEN operating at scale THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for production deployments
4. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement automated recovery mechanisms with graceful degradation
5. WHEN distributed processing is active THEN the system SHALL balance loads intelligently across available resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a financial controller, I want intelligent cost optimization and resource management, so that I can minimize operational expenses while maintaining quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL optimize token usage to reduce costs by 40-90% while maintaining output quality
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent batching and caching strategies to minimize redundant computations
3. WHEN resources are allocated THEN the system SHALL use predictive resource allocation to optimize infrastructure costs by 60-80%
4. WHEN cost tracking occurs THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive cost monitoring and optimization recommendations
5. WHEN error rates are measured THEN the system SHALL reduce costly re-generation cycles by 70-85%

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educator, I want detailed reasoning traces and pedagogical insights, so that I can understand the educational value and use generated content effectively in teaching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL produce comprehensive reasoning traces showing step-by-step problem-solving approaches
2. WHEN reasoning traces are created THEN they SHALL be adapted to the specific STREAM domain with appropriate explanation styles
3. WHEN educational content is delivered THEN the system SHALL include pedagogical recommendations and teaching suggestions
4. WHEN reasoning quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL validate coherence, educational effectiveness, completeness, and accessibility
5. WHEN learning objectives are specified THEN the reasoning traces SHALL align with and support those objectives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want multi-agent coordination and consensus mechanisms, so that I can ensure high-quality content generation through collaborative AI agent decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content generation occurs THEN the system SHALL coordinate between Generator, Validator, and Curriculum agents using reinforcement learning
2. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL use consensus mechanisms to select optimal actions
3. WHEN agent coordination happens THEN the system SHALL avoid deadlocks, infinite loops, and communication overhead
4. WHEN agents learn from feedback THEN the system SHALL update policies based on performance metrics and quality assessments
5. WHEN coordination success is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve greater than 85% coordination success rate

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive APIs and integration capabilities, so that I can seamlessly connect the platform with existing educational technology infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration requests are made THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for all core functionalities
