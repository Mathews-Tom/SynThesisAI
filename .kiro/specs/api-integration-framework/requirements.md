# API & Integration Framework - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive API and integration framework for the SynThesisAI platform. The system will provide RESTful APIs for all core functionalities, support external system integration with learning management systems, and ensure seamless interoperability while maintaining security, performance, and scalability standards.

5. WHEN API versioning is implemented THEN it SHALL support backward compatibility and smooth migration paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want seamless integration with learning management systems, so that I can embed SynThesisAI capabilities into existing educational platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LMS integration occurs THEN the system SHALL support major LMS platforms (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, Google Classroom)
2. WHEN LMS data exchange happens THEN it SHALL use standardized formats (LTI, QTI, SCORM, xAPI)
3. WHEN LMS authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support SSO and federated identity management
4. WHEN LMS content is synchronized THEN it SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
5. WHEN LMS integration is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate seamless user experience across platforms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, so that I can ensure secure access to APIs and protect sensitive educational data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys)
2. WHEN authorization is enforced THEN it SHALL implement role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
3. WHEN API security is validated THEN all endpoints SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN security policies are applied THEN they SHALL comply with educational data privacy regulations (FERPA, COPPA)
5. WHEN security monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL log and alert on suspicious API usage patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want high-performance API infrastructure, so that I can ensure fast response times and handle high-volume API traffic efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API performance is measured THEN response times SHALL be <200ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN API load increases THEN the system SHALL handle >10,000 concurrent requests without degradation
3. WHEN API caching is implemented THEN it SHALL reduce response times by 60-80% for cacheable requests
4. WHEN API rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL prevent abuse while maintaining service availability
5. WHEN API scalability is tested THEN it SHALL demonstrate linear scaling with infrastructure resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want standardized data formats and schemas, so that I can ensure consistent data exchange and interoperability across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data formats are defined THEN they SHALL use industry-standard schemas (JSON Schema, XML Schema)
2. WHEN data validation occurs THEN it SHALL enforce schema compliance for all API requests and responses
3. WHEN data transformation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide flexible mapping and conversion capabilities
4. WHEN data consistency is maintained THEN it SHALL validate data integrity across all integration points
5. WHEN data formats evolve THEN the system SHALL support schema versioning and migration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a webhook consumer, I want real-time event notifications, so that I can respond immediately to important events and maintain synchronized systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events occur THEN the system SHALL send real-time webhook notifications to registered endpoints
2. WHEN webhook delivery happens THEN it SHALL implement reliable delivery with retry mechanisms
3. WHEN webhook security is enforced THEN it SHALL use signature verification and HTTPS encryption
4. WHEN webhook management is needed THEN it SHALL provide subscription management and event filtering
5. WHEN webhook reliability is measured THEN it SHALL achieve >99% successful delivery rate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want mobile-optimized APIs, so that I can build responsive mobile applications with efficient data usage and offline capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile APIs are accessed THEN they SHALL provide optimized payloads for mobile bandwidth constraints
2. WHEN mobile synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL support offline-first architecture with conflict resolution
3. WHEN mobile authentication happens THEN it SHALL support mobile-specific authentication flows
4. WHEN mobile performance is optimized THEN APIs SHALL minimize battery usage and data consumption
5. WHEN mobile compatibility is tested THEN APIs SHALL work consistently across iOS and Android platforms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want comprehensive SDK and client libraries, so that I can easily integrate SynThesisAI capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SDKs are provided THEN they SHALL support major programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go)
2. WHEN client libraries are used THEN they SHALL handle authentication, error handling, and retry logic automatically
3. WHEN SDK documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive guides, examples, and tutorials
4. WHEN SDK updates are released THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guides
5. WHEN SDK quality is measured THEN they SHALL demonstrate high reliability and ease of use

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging and data governance, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and maintain detailed access records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API access occurs THEN all requests and responses SHALL be logged with detailed audit information
2. WHEN data governance is enforced THEN the system SHALL implement data classification and retention policies
3. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL generate automated compliance reports
4. WHEN data privacy is protected THEN the system SHALL support data anonymization and pseudonymization
5. WHEN regulatory compliance is validated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and educational privacy laws

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics for API usage, so that I can optimize performance, identify issues, and plan capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics, error rates, and usage patterns
2. WHEN API analytics are generated THEN they SHALL provide insights into user behavior and system utilization
3. WHEN API health is monitored THEN the system SHALL provide real-time health checks and status dashboards
