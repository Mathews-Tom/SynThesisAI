# Testing & Validation Framework - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing and validation framework for the SynThesisAI platform.

2. WHEN load testing is performed THEN it SHALL simulate realistic usage patterns and validate system scalability
3. WHEN performance regression is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically alert and prevent deployment
4. WHEN performance benchmarks are run THEN they SHALL measure response times, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency
5. WHEN performance validation completes THEN results SHALL be compared against baseline metrics and SLA requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want continuous integration and deployment testing, so that I can ensure safe and reliable deployments across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD pipelines execute THEN they SHALL run comprehensive test suites automatically on every code change
2. WHEN deployment testing occurs THEN it SHALL validate functionality across development, staging, and production environments
3. WHEN deployment validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure analysis
4. WHEN rollback testing is performed THEN it SHALL ensure safe rollback capabilities and data integrity
5. WHEN deployment metrics are tracked THEN they SHALL measure deployment success rate, rollback frequency, and MTTR

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security tester, I want automated security testing and vulnerability assessment, so that I can ensure the system meets security standards and is protected against threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests are executed THEN they SHALL include vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security compliance validation
2. WHEN authentication testing occurs THEN it SHALL validate all authentication methods and authorization mechanisms
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN they SHALL be classified by severity and automatically reported
4. WHEN compliance testing is performed THEN it SHALL validate adherence to security standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)
5. WHEN security test results are generated THEN they SHALL provide actionable remediation recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want comprehensive content quality testing, so that I can ensure generated content meets educational standards across all STREAM domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content quality tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate accuracy, pedagogical value, and domain-specific requirements
2. WHEN quality validation occurs THEN it SHALL test content generation across all STREAM domains with domain-specific criteria
3. WHEN quality regression is detected THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders and prevent quality degradation
4. WHEN quality metrics are measured THEN they SHALL achieve >95% accuracy and <3% false positive rates
5. WHEN quality test results are analyzed THEN they SHALL provide insights for content generation improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want integration testing across all system components, so that I can ensure seamless interaction between different parts of the SynThesisAI platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate interactions between all major system components
2. WHEN API integration testing occurs THEN it SHALL validate all API endpoints, data formats, and error handling
3. WHEN database integration is tested THEN it SHALL validate data consistency, transactions, and performance
4. WHEN external system integration is tested THEN it SHALL validate LMS integrations, webhook delivery, and third-party services
5. WHEN integration test failures occur THEN they SHALL provide detailed information about component interaction issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want chaos engineering and fault tolerance testing, so that I can ensure system resilience and validate recovery mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chaos engineering tests are executed THEN they SHALL simulate various failure scenarios and system disruptions
2. WHEN fault tolerance is tested THEN it SHALL validate system behavior under component failures, network issues, and resource constraints
3. WHEN recovery testing occurs THEN it SHALL validate automated recovery mechanisms and data integrity
4. WHEN resilience metrics are measured THEN they SHALL demonstrate system ability to maintain functionality under adverse conditions
5. WHEN chaos test results are analyzed THEN they SHALL provide recommendations for improving system resilience

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data quality analyst, I want comprehensive data validation testing, so that I can ensure data integrity, consistency, and quality throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate data integrity, consistency, and quality across all data stores
2. WHEN data migration testing occurs THEN it SHALL ensure data accuracy and completeness during migrations
3. WHEN data pipeline testing is performed THEN it SHALL validate data transformation, aggregation, and processing accuracy
4. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically flagged and reported with severity levels
5. WHEN data validation results are generated THEN they SHALL provide metrics on data quality and recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated compliance testing, so that I can ensure the system meets regulatory requirements and industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate adherence to educational data privacy regulations (FERPA, COPPA)
2. WHEN regulatory compliance is tested THEN it SHALL validate GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection requirements
3. WHEN audit trail testing occurs THEN it SHALL ensure comprehensive logging and audit capabilities
4. WHEN compliance violations are detected THEN they SHALL be immediately reported with remediation guidance
5. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN they SHALL provide evidence of regulatory adherence and compliance status
