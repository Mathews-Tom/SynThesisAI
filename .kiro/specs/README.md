All major and medium-priority specifications have been completed, providing a comprehensive roadmap for the SynThesisAI platform transformation.

## Specification Structure

Each specification follows a consistent structure:

```bash
spec-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md    # User stories and acceptance criteria
â”œâ”€â”€ design.md         # Architecture and implementation design
â””â”€â”€ tasks.md          # Detailed implementation tasks
```

## Key Performance Targets

The SynThesisAI platform aims to achieve:

- **50-70% reduction** in development time through automated prompt optimization
- **200-400% increase** in throughput through parallel processing  
- **60-80% reduction** in operational costs through intelligent resource management
- **>95% accuracy** in generated content validation
- **<3% false positive rate** in quality assessment
- **>85% coordination success rate** for multi-agent systems
- **99.9% uptime** for production deployments

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: DSPy Integration + STREAM Domain Validation
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Multi-Agent RL Coordination + Universal Quality Assurance
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Reasoning Trace Generation + Distributed Computing
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)**: Cost Optimization + API Integration + Testing Framework

## Architecture Overview

The SynThesisAI platform consists of six primary architectural layers:

1. **Domain Classification Layer**: Routes requests to appropriate STREAM domain modules
2. **DSPy Optimization Layer**: Automates prompt engineering using MIPROv2 optimizer
3. **Multi-Agent RL Coordination Layer**: Coordinates specialized agents for content generation
4. **Quality Assurance Framework**: Validates content across multiple dimensions
5. **Content Delivery Layer**: Assembles and delivers final content with reasoning traces
6. **Feedback & Adaptation Layer**: Continuously improves system performance

## Getting Started

To implement the SynThesisAI platform:

1. Review the main platform specification in `synthesisai-platform/`
2. Follow the implementation tasks in priority order
3. Use the steering files in `.kiro/steering/` for development guidance
4. Refer to individual spec designs for detailed architecture information

## Contributing
