4. WHEN forecasting models are updated THEN they SHALL continuously learn from actual usage patterns
5. WHEN capacity recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL include cost implications and optimization strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want detailed quality metrics and analytics, so that I can monitor content quality trends and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality metrics are tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor accuracy rates, validation success, and quality scores across all domains
2. WHEN quality analytics are generated THEN they SHALL identify quality trends, patterns, and anomalies
3. WHEN quality reporting occurs THEN it SHALL provide domain-specific quality insights and comparisons
4. WHEN quality degradation is detected THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders and suggest corrective actions
5. WHEN quality improvements are measured THEN the system SHALL track the effectiveness of optimization efforts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want comprehensive usage analytics, so that I can understand user behavior, feature adoption, and business impact of the SynThesisAI platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN usage analytics are collected THEN they SHALL track user interactions, feature usage, and content generation patterns

3. WHEN business metrics are calculated THEN they SHALL include user retention, feature adoption rates, and ROI analysis
4. WHEN usage reports are generated THEN they SHALL support business decision making and product development
5. WHEN privacy compliance is maintained THEN all analytics SHALL respect user privacy and data protection regulations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated alerting and incident management, so that I can respond quickly to performance issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate alerts with severity levels and context
2. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN they SHALL be delivered through multiple channels (email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty)
3. WHEN incident management is activated THEN the system SHALL provide automated escalation and response workflows
4. WHEN alert fatigue is prevented THEN the system SHALL use intelligent filtering and correlation to reduce noise
5. WHEN incident resolution is tracked THEN the system SHALL measure MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) and provide improvement insights

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cost analyst, I want cost analytics and optimization insights, so that I can track spending patterns, identify cost drivers, and optimize resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost analytics are generated THEN they SHALL provide detailed cost breakdowns by service, domain, and time period
2. WHEN cost trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify cost drivers, anomalies, and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN cost forecasting is performed THEN it SHALL predict future costs based on usage patterns and growth trends
4. WHEN cost optimization recommendations are made THEN they SHALL include projected savings and implementation effort
5. WHEN cost efficiency is measured THEN the system SHALL track cost per transaction, user, and business outcome

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want security monitoring and analytics, so that I can detect threats, monitor compliance, and ensure system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track authentication events, access patterns, and security violations
2. WHEN security analytics are generated THEN they SHALL identify suspicious activities, anomalies, and potential threats
3. WHEN compliance monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL track adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements
4. WHEN security incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated threat response and mitigation
5. WHEN security reporting is generated THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive security posture and compliance status

### Requirement 9
