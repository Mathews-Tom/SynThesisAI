# Universal Quality Assurance Framework - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive universal quality assurance framework in the SynThesisAI platform. The system will provide multi-dimensional quality validation across fidelity, utility, safety, and pedagogical value dimensions, ensuring >95% content accuracy and comprehensive quality assessment for all STREAM domains.

1. WHEN content is validated THEN the system SHALL assess fidelity, utility, safety, and pedagogical value dimensions
2. WHEN quality assessment occurs THEN all dimensions SHALL use consistent 0-1 scoring scales
3. WHEN quality results are aggregated THEN the system SHALL provide weighted overall quality scores
4. WHEN quality thresholds are not met THEN the system SHALL provide structured feedback for improvement
5. WHEN quality validation completes THEN the system SHALL achieve >95% accuracy in content assessment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content validator, I want fidelity assessment capabilities, so that I can ensure accuracy and correctness of generated content across all domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fidelity is assessed THEN the system SHALL validate factual accuracy and domain-specific correctness
2. WHEN mathematical content is assessed THEN fidelity SHALL include CAS verification and logical consistency
3. WHEN scientific content is assessed THEN fidelity SHALL include experimental validity and theoretical accuracy
4. WHEN technical content is assessed THEN fidelity SHALL include code correctness and algorithmic validity
5. WHEN fidelity scores are calculated THEN they SHALL reflect content accuracy with >95% reliability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educational content manager, I want utility evaluation capabilities, so that I can assess the educational value and usefulness of generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility is evaluated THEN the system SHALL assess learning objective alignment and educational effectiveness
2. WHEN utility assessment occurs THEN the system SHALL consider target audience appropriateness
3. WHEN utility is measured THEN the system SHALL evaluate engagement potential and motivation factors
4. WHEN utility scores are calculated THEN they SHALL reflect educational value and practical applicability
5. WHEN utility evaluation completes THEN it SHALL provide recommendations for educational improvement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a safety compliance officer, I want comprehensive safety validation, so that I can ensure all content meets ethical guidelines and safety standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN safety validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check for bias, inappropriate content, and ethical violations
2. WHEN safety is assessed THEN the system SHALL validate age-appropriateness for target audiences
3. WHEN safety validation runs THEN the system SHALL ensure cultural sensitivity and inclusivity
4. WHEN safety violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation guidance
5. WHEN safety scores are calculated THEN they SHALL maintain >99% accuracy in identifying safety issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pedagogical expert, I want pedagogical value assessment, so that I can ensure content supports effective learning and teaching practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pedagogical value is assessed THEN the system SHALL evaluate learning objective alignment
2. WHEN pedagogical assessment occurs THEN the system SHALL consider cognitive load and difficulty appropriateness
3. WHEN pedagogical value is measured THEN the system SHALL assess scaffolding and prerequisite support
4. WHEN pedagogical scores are calculated THEN they SHALL reflect teaching effectiveness potential
5. WHEN pedagogical evaluation completes THEN it SHALL provide teaching strategy recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want seamless quality assurance integration, so that I can incorporate quality validation into existing content generation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality assurance is integrated THEN it SHALL work with existing DSPy optimization and MARL coordination
2. WHEN quality validation occurs THEN it SHALL integrate with domain-specific validation modules
3. WHEN quality assessment runs THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing API endpoints
4. WHEN quality assurance fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN quality integration is measured THEN it SHALL not significantly impact system performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want quality assurance performance monitoring, so that I can track validation effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality validation performance is measured THEN the system SHALL track accuracy rates for each dimension
2. WHEN quality assessment speed is monitored THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times
3. WHEN quality validation load increases THEN the system SHALL scale validation resources automatically
4. WHEN quality metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics and reporting
5. WHEN quality performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest corrections

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a configuration manager, I want configurable quality thresholds and criteria, so that I can adapt quality standards to different educational contexts and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality thresholds are configured THEN each dimension SHALL support customizable minimum scores
2. WHEN quality criteria are updated THEN the system SHALL support rule versioning and rollback
3. WHEN quality standards change THEN the system SHALL provide migration tools for existing content
4. WHEN quality configuration is modified THEN the system SHALL validate parameter compatibility
5. WHEN quality settings are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all validation processes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a feedback analyst, I want structured quality feedback generation, so that I can provide actionable improvement recommendations for content enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality feedback is generated THEN it SHALL provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions
2. WHEN feedback is created THEN it SHALL be categorized by quality dimension and severity level
3. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL include examples and best practices for improvement
4. WHEN feedback is delivered THEN it SHALL be tailored to the specific domain and content type
5. WHEN feedback effectiveness is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate measurable content improvement

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance administrator, I want comprehensive quality reporting and analytics, so that I can monitor system-wide quality trends and make data-driven improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality reports are generated THEN they SHALL include detailed metrics for all quality dimensions
2. WHEN quality analytics are provided THEN they SHALL show trends and patterns across domains and time
3. WHEN quality dashboards are displayed THEN they SHALL provide real-time quality monitoring capabilities
4. WHEN quality insights are generated THEN they SHALL identify areas for system improvement
5. WHEN quality data is exported THEN it SHALL support integration with external analytics and reporting tools
