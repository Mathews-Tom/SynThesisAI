# Cost Optimization & Resource Management - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive cost optimization and resource management in the SynThesisAI platform.

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want resource right-sizing and optimization, so that I can ensure optimal resource allocation without over-provisioning or under-utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource right-sizing occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust resource allocations based on actual usage
2. WHEN optimization is performed THEN it SHALL eliminate resource waste while maintaining performance SLAs
3. WHEN resource monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL identify under-utilized and over-provisioned resources
4. WHEN right-sizing recommendations are made THEN they SHALL include cost impact and performance implications
5. WHEN resource optimization is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate 30-50% reduction in resource waste

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a budget manager, I want cost control and budget management features, so that I can enforce spending limits and prevent budget overruns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN budget limits are set THEN the system SHALL enforce spending controls and prevent overruns
2. WHEN cost thresholds are reached THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cost control measures
3. WHEN budget allocation occurs THEN it SHALL be distributed across services and domains based on priorities
4. WHEN spending patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide budget variance analysis and forecasting
5. WHEN cost controls are activated THEN they SHALL maintain essential services while reducing non-critical expenses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a procurement specialist, I want multi-provider cost optimization, so that I can leverage competitive pricing and avoid vendor lock-in while optimizing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL automatically select the most cost-effective option
2. WHEN provider pricing changes THEN the system SHALL adapt routing to maintain cost optimization
3. WHEN provider performance is compared THEN cost optimization SHALL consider both price and quality metrics
4. WHEN provider diversification occurs THEN it SHALL reduce dependency risks while maintaining cost efficiency
5. WHEN multi-provider optimization is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate additional 10-20% cost savings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a sustainability officer, I want energy-efficient resource management, so that I can minimize environmental impact while optimizing operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource allocation occurs THEN the system SHALL consider energy efficiency in optimization decisions
2. WHEN infrastructure choices are made THEN they SHALL prioritize energy-efficient options when cost-neutral
3. WHEN carbon footprint is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide environmental impact reporting
4. WHEN green computing options are available THEN they SHALL be factored into cost-benefit analysis
5. WHEN sustainability metrics are tracked THEN they SHALL be integrated with cost optimization reporting

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance manager, I want cost allocation and chargeback capabilities, so that I can accurately attribute costs to different business units and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost allocation occurs THEN expenses SHALL be accurately attributed to specific projects, domains, or business units
2. WHEN chargeback reports are generated THEN they SHALL provide detailed usage and cost breakdowns
3. WHEN cost attribution is performed THEN it SHALL support multiple allocation models (usage-based, fixed, hybrid)
4. WHEN billing integration occurs THEN the system SHALL support automated chargeback and invoicing
5. WHEN cost transparency is provided THEN stakeholders SHALL have visibility into their resource consumption and costs
