# DSPy Training Data Generation System - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a system for automatically generating training data for DSPy optimization when no existing training data is available. The system will create high-quality training examples from the existing problem generation pipeline, enabling DSPy optimization without requiring pre-existing datasets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to automatically generate training data from successful problem generations, so that I can enable DSPy optimization without requiring external datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates successful problems THEN it SHALL automatically capture them as potential training examples
2. WHEN training examples are captured THEN they SHALL include input parameters, generated outputs, and quality scores
3. WHEN training data is collected THEN it SHALL be stored in a structured format compatible with DSPy optimization
4. WHEN sufficient examples are collected THEN the system SHALL automatically enable DSPy optimization for that domain
5. WHEN training data generation is active THEN it SHALL not impact normal problem generation performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bootstrap training data from existing high-quality examples, so that I can quickly build a training dataset for DSPy optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bootstrapping is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate a configurable number of high-quality examples
2. WHEN examples are generated THEN they SHALL cover different difficulty levels and topics within each domain
3. WHEN bootstrapping completes THEN the system SHALL validate the quality of generated examples
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the training data SHALL be automatically saved and indexed
5. WHEN bootstrapping fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to configure training data generation parameters, so that I can control the quality and quantity of training examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring training data generation THEN the system SHALL support minimum and maximum example counts per domain
2. WHEN setting quality thresholds THEN the system SHALL only accept examples that meet specified criteria
3. WHEN configuring collection modes THEN the system SHALL support both automatic and manual training data collection
4. WHEN parameters are updated THEN the system SHALL validate configuration compatibility with DSPy requirements
5. WHEN configuration is saved THEN it SHALL be applied to future training data generation sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to validate and curate training examples, so that I can ensure high-quality training data for DSPy optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training examples are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically score them for quality
2. WHEN quality scoring occurs THEN it SHALL evaluate accuracy, coherence, relevance, and educational value
3. WHEN examples fail quality checks THEN they SHALL be excluded from the training dataset
4. WHEN manual curation is enabled THEN authorized users SHALL be able to review and approve examples
5. WHEN curation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on training data quality and coverage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to convert training examples to DSPy format, so that they can be used for optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting examples THEN the system SHALL transform them into DSPy-compatible training format
2. WHEN creating DSPy examples THEN it SHALL properly map inputs to expected outputs
3. WHEN formatting is complete THEN the system SHALL validate DSPy example structure
4. WHEN validation passes THEN examples SHALL be ready for use in MIPROv2 optimization
5. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage training data lifecycle, so that I can maintain optimal training datasets over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data ages THEN the system SHALL support automatic cleanup of outdated examples
2. WHEN new examples are added THEN the system SHALL maintain balanced representation across topics and difficulties
3. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL remove lower-quality examples first
4. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate related DSPy optimization caches
5. WHEN lifecycle management runs THEN it SHALL provide reports on data freshness and quality trends

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to incrementally build training datasets, so that I can gradually improve DSPy optimization quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting with minimal data THEN the system SHALL support incremental training data collection
2. WHEN new examples are added THEN they SHALL be integrated with existing training data
3. WHEN dataset grows THEN the system SHALL automatically retrigger DSPy optimization
4. WHEN optimization improves THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics over time
5. WHEN incremental updates occur THEN they SHALL not disrupt ongoing problem generation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to seed training data from external sources, so that I can jumpstart DSPy optimization with existing high-quality examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing external data THEN the system SHALL support common formats (JSON, CSV, YAML)
2. WHEN processing imports THEN it SHALL validate data structure and quality
3. WHEN validation passes THEN external examples SHALL be converted to internal format
4. WHEN conversion is complete THEN imported data SHALL be integrated with generated examples
5. WHEN import fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports and partial import options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want to monitor training data effectiveness, so that I can optimize DSPy performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DSPy optimization runs THEN the system SHALL track which training examples contribute most to performance
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN it SHALL identify low-value or problematic training examples
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for training data improvements
4. WHEN recommendations are applied THEN the system SHALL measure impact on DSPy optimization quality
5. WHEN monitoring detects issues THEN it SHALL alert administrators and suggest corrective actions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use synthetic training data generation, so that I can create diverse training examples when real data is limited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synthetic generation is enabled THEN the system SHALL create varied examples using different prompting strategies
2. WHEN generating synthetic data THEN it SHALL ensure diversity across mathematical topics and difficulty levels
3. WHEN synthetic examples are created THEN they SHALL be validated for correctness and educational value
4. WHEN validation passes THEN synthetic examples SHALL be mixed with real examples in training datasets
5. WHEN synthetic generation completes THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on synthetic vs real data ratios
