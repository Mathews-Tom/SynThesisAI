# DSPy Integration Architecture - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) framework into the SynThesisAI platform. DSPy will replace manual prompt engineering with automated optimization using MIPROv2 optimizer and ChainOfThought modules, enabling self-improving content generation pipelines that reduce development time by 50-70%.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to convert existing agents to DSPy modules, so that I can leverage automated prompt optimization instead of manual prompt engineering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing EngineerAgent is converted THEN it SHALL use DSPy ChainOfThought module for structured reasoning
2. WHEN existing CheckerAgent is converted THEN it SHALL use DSPy signatures for validation tasks
3. WHEN existing TargetAgent is converted THEN it SHALL use DSPy modules for problem solving
4. WHEN agent conversion is complete THEN all agents SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
5. WHEN DSPy modules are initialized THEN they SHALL load domain-specific signatures and optimization parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated prompt optimization using MIPROv2, so that I can eliminate manual prompt maintenance and improve system performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MIPROv2 optimizer is implemented THEN it SHALL automatically optimize prompts based on training data
2. WHEN optimization occurs THEN the system SHALL use training and validation datasets for each domain
3. WHEN optimization completes THEN optimized prompts SHALL be cached for reuse
4. WHEN cached optimizations exist THEN the system SHALL reuse them to avoid redundant computations
5. WHEN optimization performance is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate 50-70% reduction in development time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content generator, I want domain-specific DSPy signatures, so that I can generate content with appropriate input/output structures for each STREAM domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain signatures are created THEN each STREAM domain SHALL have specific input/output signatures
2. WHEN mathematics signature is used THEN it SHALL include problem_statement, solution, proof, and reasoning_trace outputs
3. WHEN science signature is used THEN it SHALL include experimental_design and evidence_evaluation outputs
4. WHEN technology signature is used THEN it SHALL include algorithm_explanation and system_design outputs
5. WHEN signatures are validated THEN they SHALL ensure type safety and proper data flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance optimizer, I want intelligent caching of DSPy optimizations, so that I can avoid redundant computations and improve system efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization results are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in a persistent cache
2. WHEN cache keys are generated THEN they SHALL include domain, quality requirements, and signature parameters
3. WHEN cached results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate cache freshness and relevance
4. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN it SHALL be triggered by configuration changes or performance degradation
5. WHEN cache performance is measured THEN it SHALL demonstrate 40-60% reduction in redundant computations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want seamless integration with existing architecture, so that I can maintain system stability while adding DSPy capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DSPy integration is implemented THEN existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function without changes
2. WHEN DSPy modules are used THEN they SHALL integrate with existing LLM client infrastructure
3. WHEN DSPy optimization runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with concurrent processing capabilities
4. WHEN DSPy modules fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to traditional prompt methods
5. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain operational

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want DSPy-based validation and feedback loops, so that I can continuously improve content generation quality through automated learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DSPy validation modules are implemented THEN they SHALL provide structured feedback for optimization
2. WHEN feedback loops are established THEN validation results SHALL inform prompt optimization cycles
3. WHEN quality metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be used to train and improve DSPy modules
4. WHEN optimization cycles complete THEN quality improvements SHALL be measurable and documented
5. WHEN validation fails THEN DSPy modules SHALL learn from failures to improve future performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want proper dependency management and configuration, so that I can deploy DSPy-enabled systems reliably across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DSPy dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be compatible with existing Python 3.9+ requirements
2. WHEN DSPy configuration is implemented THEN it SHALL be manageable through existing configuration systems
3. WHEN DSPy modules are deployed THEN they SHALL work consistently across development, staging, and production
4. WHEN DSPy optimization data is managed THEN it SHALL be properly versioned and backed up
5. WHEN DSPy performance is monitored THEN metrics SHALL be integrated with existing monitoring systems

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive DSPy documentation and examples, so that I can effectively implement and maintain DSPy-based features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DSPy integration is documented THEN it SHALL include architecture diagrams and implementation guides
2. WHEN DSPy examples are provided THEN they SHALL cover all STREAM domains and common use cases
3. WHEN DSPy troubleshooting guides are created THEN they SHALL address common optimization and performance issues
4. WHEN DSPy best practices are documented THEN they SHALL include signature design and optimization strategies
5. WHEN DSPy training materials are available THEN they SHALL enable team members to effectively use the system
