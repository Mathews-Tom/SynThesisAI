# STREAM Domain Validation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive validation systems across all STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) domains in the SynThesisAI platform. The system will provide domain-specific validation rules, quality assessment frameworks, and unified validation interfaces while maintaining >95% accuracy in content validation and <3% false positive rate in quality assessment.

4. WHEN technology concepts are explained THEN the system SHALL ensure current best practices and industry standards
5. WHEN cybersecurity content is generated THEN the system SHALL validate security principles and ethical guidelines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a reading educator, I want sophisticated reading validation, so that I can ensure comprehension questions and literary analysis meet educational standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comprehension questions are generated THEN the system SHALL validate question clarity and answer accuracy
2. WHEN literary analysis prompts are created THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate analytical frameworks and critical thinking
3. WHEN reading passages are selected THEN the system SHALL validate age-appropriateness and cultural sensitivity
4. WHEN vocabulary assessments are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate difficulty progression
5. WHEN critical thinking exercises are created THEN the system SHALL validate logical reasoning requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an engineering educator, I want comprehensive engineering validation, so that I can ensure design challenges and optimization problems meet professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN engineering designs are generated THEN the system SHALL validate safety factors and regulatory compliance
2. WHEN optimization problems are created THEN the system SHALL verify constraint satisfaction and objective functions
3. WHEN engineering calculations are presented THEN the system SHALL validate mathematical accuracy and unit consistency
4. WHEN materials are specified THEN the system SHALL verify material properties and availability
5. WHEN engineering ethics scenarios are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure professional ethics alignment

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an arts educator, I want nuanced arts validation, so that I can ensure creative prompts and aesthetic analysis respect cultural diversity and artistic integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creative prompts are generated THEN the system SHALL validate cultural sensitivity and inclusivity
2. WHEN aesthetic analysis is provided THEN the system SHALL ensure balanced perspectives and art historical accuracy
3. WHEN artistic techniques are described THEN the system SHALL validate technical accuracy and safety considerations
4. WHEN cultural references are made THEN the system SHALL verify cultural authenticity and respectful representation
5. WHEN artistic criticism is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure constructive and educational feedback

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable validation thresholds and rules, so that I can adapt validation criteria to different educational contexts and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation thresholds are configured THEN each domain SHALL support customizable quality score requirements
